# lab-manual-template

## Introduction

Lab manuals are effective tools for recording who we are and how we do things in a research laboratory. This repository contains a JSON schema for storing information of lab manuals in a machine- and human-readable format. The repository also contains the lab manual template that has been developed to aid researchers to create their own manuals by providing a general topics that could be included in lab manuals in a structured format and boilerplate texts for certain topics. The [bluerint](https://github.com/mjaquiery/lab-manual) webapp provides an easy-to-use interface to edit the lab manual template to create your own lab manual or other lab manual templates.

## Project structure

The lab manual templates are stored in the `/templates` folder.
